# MAT 211 Lean Homework based on "The Mechanics of Proof" by Heather Macbeth

This repository contains the Lean code for the book [The Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001), by [Heather Macbeth](https://faculty.fordham.edu/hmacbeth1), originally developed for the course Math 2001 at Fordham University.

The Lean files corresponding to each chapter of the book are in the folder [`Math2001`](https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001/tree/main/Math2001).

To complete the homework either 

(1) Use GitHub's Codespaces (which links to a virtual computer with VS Code + Lean already installed).  Click the "Code" button, choose "Codespaces" and then "Create codespace on main" 

(2) install VS Code on your computer, add the Lean4 extension (by Leanprover), clone this repository to your computer, and allow Elan to manage Lean version and toolchain. 

The simplest method to get started quickly is using Codespaces, however installing VS Code on your local computer (with Lean) helps develop skill with GitHub and software development and might provide faster load times when returing to work on an assignment.
